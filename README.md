# Mobile App Market Analysis Project

## Introduction  
This project simulates a real-world scenario where I take on the role of a Data Analyst for a company that develops Android and iOS mobile apps. The company offers its apps as free downloads on Google Play and the App Store, generating revenue through in-app advertisements and purchases.  

The primary goal is to analyze mobile app market data to recommend development strategies that maximize user engagement and advertising profits. By understanding the types of apps that attract more users, the company can make informed decisions about future app development, ensuring profitability across both platforms.
